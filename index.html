            <article class="two-column">
                <div>
                    <h3>My Strongest Traits</h3>
                    <p>
                        My strongest traits are determination, resourcefulness and clear communication,
                        supported by the fact that I am caring and always willing to learn.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My determination shows most in my work life and in the gym. When tasks become difficult,
                        I stay consistent and push through instead of giving up. That mindset helps me improve
                        little by little.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Resourcefulness is another major part of who I am. When I face challenges, I look for a
                        solution, ask questions and try different methods until things make sense. I try my best
                        not to remain stuck.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Clear communication is one of my strengths. I express myself honestly, ask direct questions
                        and try to be respectful toward others even when situations become stressful.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These traits help me stay grounded, motivated and connected to the people around me.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Hobbies and Impact on My Life</h3>
                    <p>
                        Reading helps me relax and improve my communication skills. Baking teaches me patience,
                        precision and the importance of following steps. Weight lifting reminds me that real progress
                        takes consistency and discipline.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These hobbies help me find balance, build discipline and protect my mental health.

                    <h3>My Hero: Lisa Hanna</h3>

                    <p>
                        My hero is Lisa Hanna, a Jamaican leader, advocate and former Miss World. I admire her because she represents confidence, intelligence and strong leadership. She uses her platform and her voice to support youth, women and national development, and she carries herself with grace even when facing criticism.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        One quote from her that I really like is: “You’re not behind. You’re becoming.” This reminds me that growth is a process and that everyone’s journey looks different. When I feel like I should be further ahead in life or in my studies, this mindset helps me to focus on who I am becoming instead of comparing myself to others.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Lisa Hanna inspires me to speak up, think critically about issues affecting Jamaica and use my education in Computing to contribute positively to the country.

            <h2>AI Business Idea: Personalised Fitness and Nutrition Plans</h2>

            <p>
                This AI business focuses on creating personalised fitness and nutrition plans. It would use data
                such as age, weight, lifestyle, medical needs and goals to create custom workout and meal plans
                that adjust as the user progresses.
            </p>

            <p>
                As someone who lifts weights and cares about health, this idea connects to my own life. It could
                help me stay consistent with my calories, macros and training schedule.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ethical considerations include privacy, body image pressure, bias and over reliance on AI. These
                can be addressed through encryption, disclaimers, balanced messaging and diverse training data.
            </p>

            <p>
                A real example is Strongr Fastr, which builds custom workout and meal plans for users.

        <!-- RESTORED PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT SECTION -->
        <section id="development" class="card">
            <h2>Personal Development – Reflections on Twelve Pillars (Ch. 4–7)</h2>

            <h3>Chapter 4 – The Power of Goals</h3>
            <p>
                In Chapter 4, Michael learns from Charlie that goals give direction and meaning to life. Writing goals down makes them clearer and more real because you can see them in front of you and track your progress. The chapter suggests turning big dreams into smaller, specific and measurable steps so that success becomes a daily process instead of a one-time event.
            </p>
            <p>
                This challenged me to stop keeping my goals only in my head. As a BSc Computing student, I realised I need to write down my academic, financial and fitness goals and then break each one into action steps—for example, “study security for one hour on weekdays” or “complete two programming projects this semester.” Doing this will help me move with more purpose instead of just reacting to deadlines.
            </p>

            <h3>Chapter 5 – Time Management and Discipline</h3>
            <p>
                Chapter 5 focuses on the wise use of time. Charlie explains that we must choose between the pain of discipline now or the heavier pain of regret later. Every day we are either investing our time into activities that move us forward or spending it on distractions that bring no lasting results.
            </p>
            <p>
                This reminded me that scrolling on my phone or procrastinating on assignments eventually shows up in my grades and stress levels. To apply the lesson, I need to start planning my days with intentional blocks of time for studying, projects, gym, rest and family. If I can practice discipline in how I use each hour, I will feel more in control of my life instead of always rushing at the last minute.
            </p>

            <h3>Chapter 6 – The Influence of People Around You</h3>
            <p>
                Chapter 6 teaches that the people we surround ourselves with have a powerful effect on our thinking, habits and future. Some people encourage growth and positive choices, while others pull us down or keep us stuck. Charlie advises Michael to choose friends and mentors who are living the kind of life he wants.
            </p>
            <p>
                I learned that I need to examine my own relationships. Not everyone I like is good for my long-term growth, especially if they constantly discourage my goals or invite me to ignore my responsibilities. I want to stay close to people who support my dreams, push me to improve and share similar values. This might mean creating boundaries with some friendships but it will help me become the best version of myself.
            </p>

            <h3>Chapter 7 – Never Stop Learning</h3>
            <p>
                In Chapter 7, the focus is on lifelong learning. The book explains that self-education—through reading, listening to mentors and reflecting on experiences—is just as important as formal schooling, and sometimes even more powerful. Successful people intentionally keep growing, even after they finish school.
            </p>
            <p>
                This encouraged me to treat my personal growth as my own responsibility. Beyond my classes, I can read books on programming, watch tutorials, listen to talks on leadership and even learn from mistakes at work. Instead of seeing learning as something that ends with an exam, I want to build the habit of daily growth so that I stay relevant in the tech industry and in life.
            </p>

            <h3>Overall Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                Overall, these chapters taught me that success is not accidental. It comes from clear written goals, disciplined use of time, choosing the right people to walk with and committing to lifelong learning. If I apply these principles consistently, I believe they will shape my character and help me build the future I want.
