            <h2>Personality, Hobbies and Inspiration</h2>

            <article class="two-column">
                <div>
                    <h3>My Strongest Traits</h3>
                    <p>
                        My strongest traits are determination, resourcefulness and clear communication.
                        I am caring, curious and always willing to learn.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My determination shows most in my work life and the gym. When tasks get difficult,
                        I stay consistent and push through instead of giving up.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Resourcefulness is part of who I am — when I face challenges,
                        I try different approaches, ask questions and look for solutions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Clear communication is one of my strengths. I express myself honestly and ask questions
                        when I need clarity.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Hobbies & Impact</h3>
                    <p>
                        Reading improves my communication skills and helps me relax. Baking teaches patience and
                        precision. Weight lifting reminds me that real progress comes through consistency.

                    <h3>My Hero: Lisa Hanna</h3>
                    <p>
                        My hero is Lisa Hanna, a Jamaican leader, advocate and former Miss World. I admire her because
                        she represents confidence, intelligence and strong leadership. She uses her platform and voice
                        to support youth, women and national development.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        One quote from her that I love is: “You’re not behind. You’re becoming.”  
                        It reminds me that growth is a process and everyone’s journey looks different.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Lisa Hanna inspires me to speak up, think critically about Jamaica’s issues and use my Computing
                        skills to contribute positively to the country.

            <h2>AI Business Idea: Personalised Fitness and Nutrition Plans</h2>

            <p>
                This AI concept would create customised workout and nutrition plans for users based on age, weight,
                lifestyle and goals. It would adjust over time as the user improves.

            <h2>Personal Development – Reflections on Twelve Pillars (Ch. 4–7)</h2>

            <h3>Chapter 4 – The Power of Goals</h3>
            <p>
                In Chapter 4, Michael learns from Charlie that goals give direction and meaning to life. Writing goals
                down makes them clearer and more real because you can track your progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                This challenged me to stop keeping my goals in my head and instead write them down and break them into
                steps.
            </p>

            <h3>Chapter 5 – Time Management and Discipline</h3>
            <p>
                Chapter 5 teaches that we must choose between discipline now or the pain of regret later. Time wasted on
                distractions eventually affects grades, stress and progress.
            </p>

            <h3>Chapter 6 – The Influence of People Around You</h3>
            <p>
                Chapter 6 explains that the people we surround ourselves with affect our thinking, habits and future.
                Some people encourage growth while others hold us back.
            </p>

            <h3>Chapter 7 – Never Stop Learning</h3>
            <p>
                Chapter 7 focuses on lifelong learning. Successful people intentionally keep growing through reading,
                reflection and mentorship.
            </p>

            <h3>Overall Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                These chapters taught me that success comes from clear goals, disciplined time use, choosing the right
                people and continuous learning.
